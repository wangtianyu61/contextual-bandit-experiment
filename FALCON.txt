1. estimation error of linear class is d/n.
2. tune const of learning rate.
3. high prob bound of estimation error is d log(1/delta)/n.
4. Take delta as 1/T in the experiment.
5. Estimation error does not need to be adjusted but the parameter before the learning rate needs to be adjusted.

finished.
