# contextual-bandit-experiment
An experiment by performing FALCON and benchmarks in vowpal wabbit. It shows some empirical results when comparing different algorithms in contextual bandits.

This repo contains the performance of the algorithm [FALCON](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.12699) compared with some benchmarks in the machine learning package [Vowpal Wabbit](https://vowpalwabbit.org/) by Microsoft in the area of contextual bandit. Thanks for the [Bakeoff paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.04064) and its authors and [source codes](https://github.com/albietz/vowpal_wabbit/tree/bakeoff) for great reference and consult. 

The data set comes from a lot of sources in [OpenML](openml.org), [Microsoft-Learning-to-Rank Website](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/mslr/),[Yahoo!-Learning-to-rank](https://webscope.sandbox.yahoo.com/catalog.php?datatype=c), [CPRM of Columbia University](https://www8.gsb.columbia.edu/cprm/research/datasets#Managed%20Toll%20Lanes).
